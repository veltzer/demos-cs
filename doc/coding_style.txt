The standard coding style for C# is typically based on the official Microsoft C# Coding Conventions and the .NET Framework Design Guidelines. Here's a concise overview of some key points:

Naming conventions:
	PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members
	camelCase for local variables and private fields
	Use meaningful and descriptive names
Indentation and braces:
	Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
	Opening braces on the same line as the statement
	Closing braces on a new line
Spacing:
	One space before and after operators
	No space between method name and parentheses
	One space after commas in argument lists
Organization:
	One class per file (with some exceptions)
	Use regions sparingly, if at all
Comments:
	Use XML comments for public members
	Use // for single-line comments, /* */ for multi-line
Other practices:
	Prefer explicit type declarations over var when the type is not obvious
	Use properties instead of public fields
	Favor composition over inheritance
